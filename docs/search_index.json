For each conversion rule, a reference and an example are provided to prevent from misusing the rules. The following principle of harmonization are highly recommended: Document (R code) any harmonization / conversion steps. Where possible provide propagated measure of uncertainty. This can further used as weights in the Machine Learning / model building. Any conversion that leads to inducting significant bias (over-/under-estimation of values) should we avoided. Add to the produced dataset metadata that part of data has been harmonized and specify exact method. Disclaimer: use at own risk.
