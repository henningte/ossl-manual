## Soil Spectroscopy for Global Good

[**SoilSpec4GG**](https://soilspectroscopy.org/) is a USDA-funded [Food and Agriculture Cyberinformatics
Tools Coordinated Innovation Network NIFA Award #2020-67021-32467](https://nifa.usda.gov/press-release/nifa-invests-over-7-million-big-data-artificial-intelligence-and-other) project. It brings together soil
scientists, spectroscopists, informaticians, data scientists and
software engineers to overcome some of the current bottlenecks
preventing wider and more efficient use of soil spectroscopy. A series
of working groups will be formed to address topics including calibration
transfer, model choice, outreach & demonstration, and use of
spectroscopy to inform global carbon cycle modeling. For more info refer
to: <https://soilspectroscopy.org/>.

Soil spectroscopy for global good project works closely in collaboration with 
[FAO Global Soil Partnership](http://www.fao.org/global-soil-partnership/pillars-action/5-harmonization/glosolan/en/), who also aim at building and providing 
a [GSP Soil Spectral Calibration Library and Estimation Service](http://www.fao.org/3/ca8431en/ca8431en.pdf).

## What is soil spectroscopy? 

Soil spectroscopy is the measurement of light absorption when light in the [visible, near infrared or mid 
infrared (Vis–NIR–MIR) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum) is applied to a soil surface. The proportion 
of the incident radiation reflected by soil is sensed through Vis–NIR–MIR reflectance spectroscopy. 
These characteristic spectra (see Fig. below) can then be used to estimate numerous soil attributes including: minerals, organic compounds and water.

```

## Open Soil Spectral Library

**Open Soil Spectral Library** (OSSL) is a suite of datasets, web-services, software and tutorials.
It includes:

- A soil spectral DB available from <https://db.soilspectroscopy.org>,  
- API calibration service available from <https://api.soilspectroscopy.org>,  
- Front-end solutions,  
- An R package `ossl` with all functionality used by the API,  
- Registry of global and local calibration models,  
- Tutorials included in this book,  

The OSSL-DB has been prepared following the OSSL schema which is available at:

As a general rule of thumb we recommend all contributors to use the following 
general scheme to organize Soil Observations & Measurements with three main tables 
and metadata + legends organized in other tables:

```{r soil-db, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Recommended soil profiles and soil samples database schema.", out.width="100%"}

```

To access and use Soil Spectroscopy tools also refer to <https://soilspectroscopy.org/>.

## Target variables of interest

Soil spectral scan, through the calibration procedure, are used to determine various soil variables. 
[GLOSOLAN's Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)](http://www.fao.org/global-soil-partnership/glosolan/soil-analysis/standard-operating-procedures/en/#c763834) list four groups of soil variables of interest to international soil spectroscopy projects:

Soil chemical variables:

- pH,  
- Carbon,  
- Phosphorous,  
- Potassium,  
- Nitrogen,  
- Exchangeable cations and CEC,  
- Extractable microelements,  
- Trace and major element analyses,  
- Gypsum,  
- Electrical conductivity and total soluble salt content,  
- Soluble sulfate and chloride analysis,  
- Special analysis for peats, mineral and organic soils, agriculture and forest,  

Soil physical variables:

- Bulk density,  
- Coarse fragments,  
- Particle-size distribution,  
- Water retention curve,  
- Porosity,  
- Hydraulic conductivity function,  
- Aggregate stability,  
- Moisture content,  

Soil biological variables:

- Microbial biomass,  
- Soil Respiration,  
- Enzyme activity,  
- Microbial identification,  

Soil contaminants:

- Heavy metal elements: As, Hg, Cu, Cd, Pb and similar,  
- Other soil pollutants,  

This list is constantly updated. In the OSSL we focus on soil variables for which 
there is enough global calibration measurements to fit reasonable models. Currently, 
the largest component of the OSSL is the [USDA's KSSL](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/soils/research/) data that list about 60 variables for which 
there is enough data to fit calibration models.

## Contributing data

We encourage public and private entities to help this project and share SSL data. 
The following four modes of data sharing are especially encouraged:

1. Open your data by releasing it under Creative Commons ([CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), [CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/))  
or Open Data Commons Open Database License ([ODbL](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/)). 
This data can then directly imported into the OSSL.  
2. Donate a small part (e.g. 5%) of your data (release under [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), [CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) and/or [ODbL](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/)). 
This data can then directly imported into the OSSL.  
2. Allow SoilSpectroscopy.org project direct access to your data so that we can run data mining 
and then release ONLY results of data mining under some Open Data license.  
3. Use OSSL data to produce new derivative products, then share them through own 
infrastructures OR contact us for providing hosting support.  

We can sign professional **Data Sharing Agreements** with data producers 
that specify in detail how will the data be used. Our primary interest is in enabling research, 
sharing and use of models (calibration and prediction) and collaboration of groups 
across borders.

We take especial care that your data is secured, encrypted where necessary, 
and kept safely, closely following our [privacy policy and terms of use](https://www.woodwellclimate.org/privacy-policy/).
